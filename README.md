# The Queer Book Nook Website

An LGBT+ book review website created during web development course, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Showcased on this site
- Used semantic tags and adding alt text to images in HTML for accessibility.
- Used HTML metadata to include information that would improve SEO.
- Used high contrast colours throughout the site to ensure legibility and accessibility.
- Used CSS Grid to format the website as a whole, and using CSS Flexbox to format smaller areas.
- Created a responsive site that adjusts based on size of device window. This includes font sizes, images and adjusting the overall page structure to accommodate smaller devices. This site was developed with a desktop-first mindset.
- Used JavaScript to create a quiz, using functions and if/else statements to calculate scores associated with differing results based on user input. Results appear on website using JavaScript, rather than as a prompt box for better user experience.

## Updated after first code review of site
- Altered colour scheme to fit the site's theme better
- Edited usage of CSS Flex to make aside better at being responsive
- Edited layout of quiz so that image is aligned on the left side of the quiz
- Added new specific review pages, and linked them to their correct image or card on any webpage.
- Added appropriate external and internal links.
- Created a rainbow stripe using a HTML div and CSS only, applying this to the site to section it out while keeping in theme.
