        <!--PARAGRAPH-->
        <p>
          'Babel' by R.F. Kuang is a captivating tale that delves into the
          complex issues of colonialism and identity, weaving together a
          narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking. One of the
          book's strengths lies in its well-crafted characters, although there
          are instances where they may feel a bit flat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The romantic development between Robin and Ramy, while a commendable
          attempt at representing LGBTQ+ people of color, seemed somewhat
          overshadowed and lacked the depth that the rest of the narrative
          exuded. It felt like a secondary element, leaving me yearning for a
          more profound exploration of their relationship. Therefore, this book
          should not be recommended as an 'LGBT+ book' and gladly, the book's
          promotion does not rely on its LGBT+ inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, the novel shines in its deeper interrogation of the
          implications of colonialism. Kuang skillfully explores the challenges
          faced by immigrants and those stolen from their native lands as they
          struggle to assimilate into new environments. The author's portrayal
          of this struggle is poignant and provides a necessary reflection on
          the difficulties faced by individuals grappling with their stolen
          heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book's tone, while at times direct, is well-suited to the overall
          narrative. It might be argued that the message could have been
          delivered in more nuanced ways, but the straightforward approach
          aligns with the book's atmosphere and does not detract from its
          impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standout feature of 'Babel' is the incorporation of footnotes,
          showcasing Kuang's impressive linguistic knowledge. These moments
          elevate the book, making it feel like a meticulously executed thesis.
          While some may argue that it veers towards a more academic style,
          these footnotes were the most captivating aspects and allowed the
          reader to connect with the author themselves. Kuang's skill in this
          area suggests a potential for equally compelling non-fiction works on
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Babel' is a book that successfully tackles significant themes such as
          colonialism and identity. While there are moments that could benefit
          from more depth, the novel's strengths lie in its exploration of
          complex issues, and the author's linguistic prowess. Kuang's potential
          for non-fiction writing in the realm of language is evident and adds
          an extra layer of appreciation for this already thought-provoking
          work.

            Kuang completed her Master's degree in Chinese Studies at the
            University of Cambridge, focusing on 20th-century Chinese military
            history. Her academic background deeply influences the intricate
            world-building and historical nuances present in her novels.
